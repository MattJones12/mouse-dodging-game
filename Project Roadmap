The game is going great I have pretty much finished the game. I have functionallity for the mouse. He can move left and right.
Blocks have been added and move

Blocks now detect the mouse and when hit the game ends (next goal is to make a game over sign)
I've been able to add code to the project so I can change the speed of the traps. But I also found a way to control the traps so lengths of the blocks become greater as well
