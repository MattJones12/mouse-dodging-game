A project by Matt Jones.
The idea for this game is to create a game where a mouse has to dodge mouse traps. I want to have a score counter and add a starting menu. I want to be able to control the rate and speed of the game. If i can figure out how to add challenges tot he game that will be an added bonus. My goal is also to have a basic starting screen. I have found some general code for a dodging game and would like to base my game off of it. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44812601/im-trying-to-make-a-dodging-game-with-pygame
